Welcome to the Womens-Clothing-E-Commerce-Reviews-data-set repository!

In this project,
I used Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews data set, and try to explore and visualize as much, 
using Plotly’s Python graphing library and Bokeh visualization library. Not only explore text data, but also visualized numeric and categorical features.

## Let's Start.............

-Remove the “Title” feature. </br>
-Remove the rows where “Review Text” were missing. </br>
-Clean “Review Text” column. </br>
-Using TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity which lies in the range of [-1,1] where 1 means positive sentiment and -1 means a negative sentiment.</br> 

# Key Features
1. Univariate visualization with Plotly. 
2. The distribution of review sentiment polarity score.
3. The distribution of review ratings.
4. The distribution of reviewers age.
5. What do the departments tell about Sentiment polarity
